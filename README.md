-In order to run the file locally, first navigate to the Web.config located in the "DonareSange" project
  (ATTENTION! not the one in Views folder)
-After that open the file, and you would need to find the "DefaultConnection", and replace/modify the connection
  string's DataSource by one that is valid for your system
-In order to recreate the database on your server go to the Models folder in the project, there you can find a file named "Model.edmx", 
  open it
-On the diagram, right click the mouse, and choose the "Generate database from model" option
